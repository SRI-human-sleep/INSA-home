## Appendices
- `Appendix A - Diary form/` includes the items of the electronic diary form used in the study, [depicted at this page](https://sri-human-sleep.github.io/INSA-home/Appendix%20A%20-%20Diary%20form/insa%40home_appendixA_diaryForm.pdf).

- `Appendix B - Data pre-processing/` includes the R code and the generated report of the pre-processing procedures applied to the raw data (available upon request to the corresponding author). The **data pre-processing report** is [depicted at this page](https://sri-human-sleep.github.io/INSA-home/Appendix%20B%20-%20Data%20pre-processing/insa%40home_dataProcessing.html).

- `Appendix C - Data analysis/` includes the R code and the generated reports of the data analysis described in the article: 
  - Part 1 - [**Descriptives and phychometrics**](https://sri-human-sleep.github.io/INSA-home/Appendix%20C%20-%20Data%20analysis/insa%40home_dataAnalysis1.html)
  - Part 2 - [**Characterization of sleep and diary ratings**](https://sri-human-sleep.github.io/INSA-home/Appendix%20C%20-%20Data%20analysis/insa%40home_dataAnalysis2.html)
  - Part 3 - [**Relationships between sleep and diary ratings**](https://sri-human-sleep.github.io/INSA-home/Appendix%20C%20-%20Data%20analysis/insa%40home_dataAnalysis3.html). This also includes the final outputs included in the main article.

- `Appendix D - Data/` includes the two datasets (in both .RData and .csv format) generated with the data pre-processing script included in Appendix B, and used to generate the reports in Appendix C: 
  - `ema` with time-varying variables
  - `demos` with demographic variables
